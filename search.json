    "section": "So What’s a Digital Twin?",
    "text": "So What’s a Digital Twin?\n\n\nAsk 10 academics and get 10 different answers, but at it’s most basic we’re talking about a virtual representation of a physical object. The term seems to have emerged around 2005, but it’s not hard to trace it back substantially further to, for example, Gelernter (1993)’s Mirror World, or the Day Software Puts the Universe in a Shoebox…. In a built environment context, as the two images on the left show we might even trace it back to the 1980s — top is a model of an English village, and below that is an output from a SOM-generated model for 9 US cities — and attempts to understand the relationship between difference forms and masses in the real world. On the right is an early attempt to superimpose other contextual information — pollution in this case — on to a 3D surface.\nBut the twin isn’t intended just to represent the real world, it’s intended to enable prediction and control. The twin is thus tightly coupled with the system that it represents and this forms the foundation for its capacity to act upon the real world. As our access to ‘compute’ has expanded so has our ambition for the scale of system to be monitored and controlled, and it’s at this point that the digital twin concept starts to align with the ‘smart city’ initiatives undertaken in many cities around the world, and embodied in the governmental rhetoric of countries such as India."

But physical processes are much easier to model in a tightly-coupled way than social and economic ones, which are necessarily much more abstract representations of any underlying reality.\nIn the latter case, the flow of information can take more complex forms: whereas for simple physical systems the flow of information can be explicitly bidirectional and automated (as they are between BIM and the physical plant of an estate), in the case of cities the transfer is no longer automated and may even be non-digital such as, for example, the way that model outputs can change our underlying understanding of the problem that we are trying to tackle!"

    "text": "Frequency of Update\n\nUrban Analytics \\(\\approx\\) High Frequency\nUrban Theory \\(\\approx\\) Low Frequency\n\n\nI think also that the ‘smart city’ is associated with high frequency change: with the instrumentation of infrastructures and mobility platforms, the spread of computation into every thing around us. You can think of the ‘smart trees’ at this year’s Chelsea Garden Show which report their needs on a regular basis to a centralised home hub, or the ongoing monitoring of sewerage for early warnings of new pandemics.\nIn the high-frequency world we can use the twin to influence the real thing. Real-time data about the Tube system doesn’t just mirror what’s happening in the Tube, it is used to shape and change the physical infrastructure. So the idea of the smart city in that it is not just about an embedding of soft into hard but of hard becoming soft.\nBut when we try to use high frequency data to forecast what cities might look like in ten, twenty, or thirty years we run into problems: predictability dissolves, and “our current predictions for many social processes are at present not better than two-to-three-day weather forecasting.”"

But the Digital Twin therefore has to be something more than this: the twin essentially merges with with the artifact and can no longer function separately. But for any model to function, there must be some latency between the real thing and the thing simulated – the model.\nProgrammers distinguish between shallow and deep copies. They mean this in a very particular way about copying references (pointers to the real data) and copying values (the data itself). But I can’t help thinking that the idea of copying values inadvertently throws up its deeper meaning as well: our digital twins copy normative values about what matters to us and to our systems? Maybe there is no such thing as a deep copy of a city?"

So rather than thinking about ‘the one true twin’, we have a plethora of perspectives that are rooted in the slow cycles of theory. They are hierarchical and contradictory, overlapping and multi-scalar."
